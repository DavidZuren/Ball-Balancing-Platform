# Ball-balancing-platform
This program tackles the theoretical construction and simulation of a control system using MATLAB and Simulink/Simscape with the purpose of controlling a Ball Balancing Platform. The "physical" system is constructed in the Multibody environment and a cascade control structure is implemented using two PIDs capable of reacting to disturbances. The desired position of the ball and the controller's gains are manipulated through an intuivitve HMI.
